## Key points that every developer must master:
1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software     
    > a single purpose of all software: To help people.
2. The Goals of Software Design
    > Every programmer is a designer. 
    > So there are two key points here: 
    > - Your design should be easy for you 
    > - helpful for others.
3. (Mis)understanding
    > Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer.
4. Simplicity
    > Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
5. Complexity
    > Your main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.
6. Maintenance
    > The one rule that you should follow about maintenance is:
    >
    > **It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.**
7. Consistency
8. Prioritizing
    > When you prioritize your work, you should follow this rule:
    >
    > **The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little  value and require a lot of effort.**
9. Solving Problems
    > for solving problem you need 3 steps:
    > - The first step is understanding.
    > - The second step is planning.
    > - The third step is dividing.
10. Good enough is fine 
    > Perfect is the enemy of good.
11. Predictions 
    > A prediction is simply a forecast that something will happen in the future. It could be factual and based on some kind of objective data or it could be based on an assumption.
12. Assumptions 
    > An assumption is something that you accept as true or suppose to be true, although you have no conclusive proof.
    >
    > To avoid being a victim like this developer, follow this simple rule:
    >
    > **Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.**
13. Stop Reinventing
14. Resistance
15. Automation
16. Code measurement 
    > The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.
17. Productivity 
    > Your main goal should be keeping your code base as small as possible.
18. Testing
19. (Under)Estimation 
    > Everything takes longer than you think.
20. Running Away From Rewriting
21. Documentation and Commenting
22. Picking Technologies (Tools, Libraries, etc.)
23. Self-Development "Keep learning"
24. Don’t be a hero
25. Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help
